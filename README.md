    - Ian - Making sure we are understanding each other’s ideas and are on the same page. Keeping track of our progress and remaining tasks.
    - Cody - project planning
    - Ricardo - Making sure our team needs are being met.

  - Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?
    - Build a plan for the day (checklist perhaps) during a morning 10-min huddle; consider individual  strengths, divvy workload amongst team; if struggling ask for pair/team help afternoon check-n for end of day tasks and needs for the next day.  Take regularly scheduled “human time” each hour. If someone is spinning their wheels (15-min rule); speak up.

**NOTE**: *Undoing, Redoing, Replacing, or otherwise steamrolling the project as an individual is considered to be unacceptable. Account for the inevitable divergence of ideas, execution tasks, and assignments of duties here.*

### Work Plan
